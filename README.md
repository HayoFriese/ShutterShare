# ShutterShare
Shuttershare is a school project where I grouped up with four other individuals to create a prototype where users can rent out camera's.

The project used some plugins but due to the lack of familiarity with other browsers amongst groupmates, we unanimously decided to create a site that works through PHP scripts and JS Plug-ins.

The prototype is a platform that makes use of a SQL Database that stores all the information a camera owner wishes to present to their potential customers. In addition, users who look to rent a camera can also store their profile details for quick check out after registering.

My role was the managing of the project, alongside developing and designing the messaging system, as well as the advert page.
